# JS

JavaScript files will be stored here


# Files

1 js page per html for organization

stackedit i guess

## edit.js functions
- parse date from url since we access html/edit by adding ?date=xxx
- create new md with hidden json 
    - who owns file
    - date created
    - last modified (maybe)
- integrate stackedit
- view/edit modes

## index.js functions
- check login
    - redirect if not
- call database for files of current user
    - update the html

## login.js functions
- check if logged in
- check if credentials correct
- reset password

## signup
- check if logged in
- signup
- check if username is in use
- pw strength thing?

## idk where to put these, like all pages use them, maybe a global.js
- toggle darkmode
- get current user
- there's definitely more that can apply to all that i'm forgetting
